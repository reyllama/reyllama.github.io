I'm a student in Seoul National University, currently studying statistics, math and machine learning. Especially interested in generative models, I'm dreaming of creating realife applications, e.g. creating full-length animations based on books(novels) and building more-than-real VR space. 

Two of my favorite things in life are music and travelling. I love playing the piano, from contemporary to jazz and classic. My musical orientation skews towards lofi, chill, dupstep, afro-jazz and hiphop. Youtube music is my best friend here. 

Although for now the global pandemic prohibits free traveling, I wish to whenever is possible. My favorite places include Cusco, Istanbul, Siem Reap and Tokyo. 

Hope you enjoy my place! :)
